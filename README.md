# 🎓 Learning Journey – Full-Stack AI Course Generator

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It is a fully functioning **AI-powered web application** that generates structured learning courses based on a topic and custom units provided by the user.

The application uses **OpenAI's API** with advanced prompt engineering to generate educational content, **Unsplash API** for related course images, **YouTube API** to fetch relevant videos, and **video transcript summarization** for quick insights.  
User authentication is enabled via **Google Login (Google Cloud API)**.  
The backend uses **Prisma ORM** configured with **PlanetScale**, a MySQL-compatible serverless database.
